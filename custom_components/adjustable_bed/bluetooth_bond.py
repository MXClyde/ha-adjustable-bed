"""Exact inspection and removal of bonds stored by the Home Assistant host.

A BLE bond belongs to whichever transport created it. The host's BlueZ stores
bonds for adapters plugged into the host; an ESPHome proxy keeps its own, and
neither can see the other's. Two rules follow, and everything here exists to
enforce them:

1. Host BlueZ state is never evidence about a proxy bond, or the reverse
   (issue #459).
2. A host-side unpair never runs for a bond that does not live on the host
   (issue #455).

Three properties matter more than convenience:

**A failed read is not an empty result.** ``bluetooth_adapters``'
``get_dbus_managed_objects()`` swallows D-Bus authentication, socket, timeout
and reply failures and returns ``{}``. That is fine for discovery and fatal for
a destructive action: "I could not ask" would look identical to "there is no
bond", and an unpair would report success having done nothing. This module talks
to BlueZ directly so a read failure stays a read failure.

**One address can exist under several adapters.** A host with two Bluetooth
adapters can hold two independent bonds for the same bed. Removal therefore
names an exact adapter and device object, and refuses when the caller has not
said which one it means.

**Removal is verified, not assumed.** A successful ``RemoveDevice`` reply is not
proof. The object tree is re-read afterwards, that read must itself succeed, and
the record must be gone or report both ``Paired`` and ``Bonded`` false.
