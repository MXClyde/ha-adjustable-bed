"""Freshness gate for setup-time BLE probes and pairing attempts.

Home Assistant keeps a bed in its Bluetooth history for a while after the bed
stops advertising, and it hands out a ``BLEDevice`` built from that history. A
bed that has gone to sleep, been unplugged or moved out of range therefore still
*looks* present, and the probe or pairing attempt that follows spends its full
connection timeout failing. Worse, that failure is easy to misread as "pairing
is broken" or "the bond is stale", which is exactly the misdiagnosis issue #459
forbids.

So before any setup-time connection, ask a narrower question than "does Home
Assistant know about this address": *has this bed advertised recently, on a
connectable scanner, with a usable signal reading?* Only then resolve a fresh
``BLEDevice`` and connect.

Two signals matter:

* **Age.** ``BluetoothServiceInfoBleak.time`` is a coarse monotonic timestamp of
  the last advertisement. ``habluetooth`` will keep a connectable record for up
  to ``CONNECTABLE_FALLBACK_MAXIMUM_STALE_ADVERTISEMENT_SECONDS`` (195 s) when it
  has not learned the device's advertising interval, so "present in history" can
  mean "last heard over three minutes ago".
* **RSSI invalidation.** BlueZ reports ``-127`` when it has no valid reading for
  a device — the value ``habluetooth`` also uses as its "no RSSI" sentinel. A
  record carrying it proves the adapter is not currently hearing the bed.
